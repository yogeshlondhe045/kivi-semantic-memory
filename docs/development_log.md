# Development Log

Chronological record of what was built, what was run, what failed and how it was fixed.

## Phase 0 — Environment inspection
- Detected Ubuntu 24.04.4, no ROS, no Gazebo, no GPU, no display.
- `packages.ros.org` and `packages.osrfoundation.org` → HTTP 403 (egress policy). Chose RoboStack
  (conda-forge) for ROS 2 Jazzy + Gazebo Harmonic; bootstrapped `micromamba` from conda-forge
  because `micro.mamba.pm` was also blocked.
- EGL headless rendering crashed the ogre2 engine (no DRM device). Installed `xvfb` and Mesa
  from the Ubuntu archive; GPU lidar then worked with llvmpipe under Xvfb.

## Phase 1 — Requirements and architecture
- Wrote `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`.
- Decision: generate world, map, keepout mask and WMS slot table from one layout YAML.
- Decision: rename the proposed `simulation_interfaces` package to `uco_interfaces` to avoid
  clashing with the upstream ROS `simulation_interfaces` package.
