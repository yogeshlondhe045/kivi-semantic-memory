# Development Log

Chronological record of what was built, what was run, what failed and how it was fixed.

## Phase 0 — Environment inspection
- Detected Ubuntu 24.04.4, no ROS, no Gazebo, no GPU, no display.
- `packages.ros.org` and `packages.osrfoundation.org` → HTTP 403 (egress policy). Chose RoboStack
  (conda-forge) for ROS 2 Jazzy + Gazebo Harmonic; bootstrapped `micromamba` from conda-forge
  because `micro.mamba.pm` was also blocked.
- EGL headless rendering crashed the ogre2 engine (no DRM device). Installed `xvfb` and Mesa
  from the Ubuntu archive; GPU lidar then worked with llvmpipe under Xvfb.

## Phase 1 — Requirements and architecture
- Wrote `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`.
- Decision: generate world, map, keepout mask and WMS slot table from one layout YAML.
- Decision: rename the proposed `simulation_interfaces` package to `uco_interfaces` to avoid
  clashing with the upstream ROS `simulation_interfaces` package.

## Phase 2 — Repository and ROS 2 workspace
- Created `uco_interfaces` (9 msgs, 13 srvs, 2 actions) and `uco_common` (layout model,
  container SDF factory, alert helper, QoS profiles) plus `scripts/env.sh`, `build.sh`, `test.sh`.
- Issues found and fixed:
  - pytest 9 (pulled by conda) breaks the Jazzy `launch_testing` pytest plugin
    (`PluginValidationError: ... {'path'}`) → pinned `pytest>=8,<9`.
  - setuptools 84 breaks `colcon build --symlink-install` for ament_python packages
    (`option --editable not recognized`) → pinned `setuptools<80` (apt Jazzy ships 68).
  - colcon ran unittest (0 tests) once `tests_require` was removed → declared pytest via
    `extras_require={'test': ['pytest']}`.
- Verification: `scripts/build.sh` OK; `scripts/test.sh` → 18 tests, 0 failures
  (layout parsing, id format, alias resolution, access poses clear of obstacles and restricted
  zones, slot spacing, speed/restricted zone queries, container mass/SDF).
